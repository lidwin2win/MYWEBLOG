# MYWEBLOG

CTF backend task-2
A simple weblog which allows any user to post 'non-empty posts' and allows others to comment on a particular post

i MANUALLY created & used a db named 'blog' and a table for storing posts named 'posts' with two columns namely 'id' and 'post' where 'id' is of type  AUTO_INCREMENT ,I HAVE ALSO INCLUDED THE  'posts.sql' EXPORT FILE FOR CREATING THE DB

For writing comments i created separate table for each posts using SQL commands in my PHP code thus are taken care in RUN TIME
